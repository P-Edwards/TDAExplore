#If there are infinite persistence intervals(and the value above is set to 1),

#If there are infinite barcodes possible,                                      \
    they either can be ignored or not by the PLT.
#If you do not wnat them to be ignored,                                        \

#If the infinite barcodes are not to be ignored and                            \
    the variable shallInfiniteBarcodesBeIgnored
#is set to false, then please provide below the value which should be used by  \

#The Persistence Landscape Toolbox(PLT)                                        \
    can compute distances using two different
#representations of landscapes.The first, and default one,                     \
    is the representation that
#uses pairs(critical point, critical value).Alternative representation,        \
    which may be
#faster in some cases,                                                         \
    is a grid - base one.In case of grid - base representation we assume
#that the begin and end points of the intervals are sampled from a finite,     \
    uniformly
#distributed grid.If this is the case in your computations,                    \
    please set the variable
#belowto true.
    0
#
#in case grid is used in a computations,                                       \
    you need to provide a grid diameter here.
